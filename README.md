# JuQueue
Computation and workflow management system for **time-constrained** cluster environments.
This system is aimed at compute clusters, on which users are accounted 
for the runtime of an entire node or *minimum resource allocation units* 
(e.g. at the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC)).

Work in progress and potentially unstable. The [wiki](https://github.com/tran-khoa/JuQueue/wiki) provides further documentation.

## Concept
- **Runs**
  - Defines the command and its corresponding parameters.
  - Defines an Executor which determines environment variables, virtual environments, etc...
  - Commands should be robust to termination, i.e.  
    - Should resume from previous computation if terminated.
      - If the Node shuts down/fails, the Run will be requeued.
    - Upon failure, must return a non-zero status code. [will not be requeued]
    - Must return status code 0 if completed. [will not be requeued]
- **Experiment**
  - A logical group of Runs.
- **Clusters**
  - Each Cluster (currently `local` and `slurm`) defines a group of nodes.
  - A ClusterManager manages NodeManagers on computation nodes (e.g. via SLURM jobs).
    - Each NodeManager specifies a certain number of Slots and manages the execution of Runs in Python subprocesses.
    - As Runs are (un-)queued from/to the Cluster, or are completed/failed, the number of nodes is rescaled as necessary.
  - For now, the system is aggressive in minimizing the number of nodes, e.g.
    - Assume 4 nodes (each with 4 slots), each executing a single Run
    - Then 3 nodes are cancelled (along with the runs) and rescheduled to the remaining node. 

## Installation
### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tran-khoa/JuQueue juqueue
cd juqueue
pip install -e .

# (optional) Start with example definitions
cp -r example_defs ~/defs
```
### Via pip
```bash 
pip install juqueue
```

## Usage
```bash
juqueue --def-dir [PATH] --work-dir [PATH]
```

A minimal user interface is offered at [localhost:51234](http://localhost:51234).
For more advanced usage, JuQueue can be controlled via FastAPI's interactive docs 
available at [localhost:51234/docs](http://localhost:51234/docs).

## Documentation
For now, refer to the examples in [example_defs/](./example_defs) and FastAPI's docs,
