# JuQueue
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/juqueue.svg">](https://pypi.org/project/juqueue/)

Computation and workflow management system for **time-constrained** cluster environments.
This system is aimed at compute clusters, on which users are accounted 
for the runtime of an entire node or *minimum resource allocation units* 
(e.g. at the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC)).

Work in progress and potentially unstable. The [wiki](https://github.com/tran-khoa/JuQueue/wiki) provides further documentation.
